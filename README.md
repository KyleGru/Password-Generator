# Password-Generator

## Description
In this project I have written code in JavaScript to create a random password generator. The process of this website begins with the user pressing the "generate password" button. Once the user presses the button they are presented with a box that will give them prompts for the password criteria. when the user clicks through all of the promts they will be presented with randomly generated password that will be printed to the text box on the browser site page.
